gradient_bandit:
  alpha: 0.1  # Step size parameter
  baseline: true  # Whether to use average reward as baseline

# The Gradient Bandit agent uses a softmax policy with gradient ascent.
# It maintains preferences for each action and updates them based on received rewards.
# Parameters:
#   - alpha: Controls the step size of the gradient update (higher = faster learning)
#   - baseline: If true, uses the average reward as a baseline to reduce variance
