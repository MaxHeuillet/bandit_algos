    # Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian approach to the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
    # It maintains a Beta distribution for each action, representing the uncertainty about its reward probability, and
    # samples from these distributions to choose the next action.
    # The Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli likelihood, which makes it a natural choice for modeling the probability of success for a given action.
    # The Beta distribution has two parameters, alpha and beta, which represent the number of successes and failures, respectively.
    # The mean of the Beta distribution is alpha / (alpha + beta), which is the expected reward probability for the action.
    # The variance of the Beta distribution is alpha * beta / ((alpha + beta)^2 * (alpha + beta + 1)), which measures the uncertainty about the reward probability.
    # Thompson Sampling works by sampling from the Beta distributions for each action and choosing the action with the highest sample value.
    # This approach balances exploration and exploitation by leveraging the Beta distribution's properties to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
